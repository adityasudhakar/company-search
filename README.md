Company Search Chatbot

A demo project that shows how to build a company search assistant using:

OpenAI File Search / Vector Stores → for answering from documents

Vanna API → for querying structured analytics data

The chatbot can answer questions from uploaded company files and also handle structured queries such as usage metrics.

Features

Upload and index your own documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)

Natural language search across documents

Route analytics questions to the Vanna API

Combine unstructured and structured results in one chatbot

Setup
1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/adityasudhakar/company-search.git
cd company-search

2. Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows PowerShell

3. Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure environment variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in your own keys:

cp .env.example .env


Inside .env:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
VANNA_API_KEY=your-vanna-api-key
VANNA_USER_EMAIL=your-email@company.com
VECTOR_STORE_ID=your-vector-store-id


⚠️ Never commit .env to GitHub. Only .env.example is shared.

Upload files & create a vector store
python upload_files.py
python vectorstore.py
python files_to_vector.py
